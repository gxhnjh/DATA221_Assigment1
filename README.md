Question 1
Stores a threshold value and multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1. Tracks the current multiplier and running product. Prints the final product and the integer that caused the product to exceed the threshold.

Question 2
Prompts the user to enter words separated by commas and cleans the input by removing extra spaces.  It builds a nested dictionary using each word as a key.  
Each value stores the string’s length and whether the length is even or odd.


Question 3
This code defines a function that computes x raised to the power y.  
Uses a for loop with argument unpacking to process a list of (x, y) pairs and skips any negative exponents.  
Stores all valid results in a list and prints the final list.


Question 4
Generates a list of random values between 0 and 1 and a random value x.  
Sorts the list and finds all indices where values are greater than or equal to x.  
Prints the sorted list, the value of x, and the first matching index if one exists.


Question 5
It prompts the user for two circle radii and validates that both values are positive integers.  
Computes the area of each circle and determines which is larger.  
Returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle.


Question 6
My code accepts a list of numbers from the user and identifies all unique values.  
Calculates the percentage of elements that are less than or equal to each unique value.  
Returns and prints the resulting dictionary sorted by key.


Question 7
Prompts the user for a number of seconds since midnight and validates the input.  
Converts the value into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM or PM.
Returns and prints a formatted time string.


Question 8
Creates a DataFrame using the provided column data with pandas.  
Adds a new column derived from existing columns using a computed formula.  
Prints the final DataFrame for review.
